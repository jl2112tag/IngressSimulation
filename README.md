# Liquid Ingress Simulation
Liquid Ingress Simulation Tool is a simple experimental tool to visually see how a hydrated component affect adjacent components in a matrix based network system. This tool is created using MATLAB Appdesigner and requires 'Statics and Machine Learning Toolbox' installed to run 'normpdf (normal probability density function). Please keep in mind that this tool was developed to see how pore-network saturation affects to the liquid ingress in the axial direction as a function of time and the hydration process (capillary drive water imbibition) cannot be fully scientific but more close to a contagious model of each pore.
